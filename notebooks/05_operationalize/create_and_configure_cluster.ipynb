    "# Configure Azure Databricks for Reference Architecture for Recommendation Systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this notebook is to simplify the deployment of the real-time recommendation API on Azure architecture as described [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/reference-architectures/ai/real-time-recommendation).\n",
    "\n",
    "Specifically, this notebook allows you to programmatically do the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create a databricks cluster of the appropriate version\n",
    "2. Install necessary libraries.\n",
    "3. Upload the primary notebook to the databricks workspace if it doesn't alreadyd exist.\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary impetus for this is to simplify the creation of the databricks cluster for the end-to-end walkthrough in the notebook [here](./als_movie_o16n.ipynb). As of 2019-01-17, the recommended version of spark can no longer be deployed through the databricks portal because it is deprecated.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Running this notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "You can run this notebook in two different ways. In both cases, please see the notes regarding dependencies. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. You can manually run through the notebook through jupyter. When doing so, make sure to adjust your `TOKEN`, `DOMAIN`, and other parameters in the first code cell below.\n",
    "2. You can install [`papermill`](https://github.com/nteract/papermill) and run it using papermill. When doing so, the easiest approach is to pass the relevant parameters (from the first code cell below) as arguments, e.g.:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "papermill create_and_configure_cluster.ipynb OUTPUT.ipynb -p TOKEN XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX -p DOMAIN westus.azuredatabricks.net -p cluster_name my_papermill_cluster\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Known Issues\n",
    "\n",
    "You may see SSL errors occasionally, or libraries may fail to get installed. The best way to do fix this is to restart the cluster."

    "## Dependencies\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Python dependencies\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to execute this notebook, you must have two python libraries installed:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `python-dotenv` to load and manage an access token if it is not being run via papermill (see authentication below)\n",
    "- `requests` to send the REST calls\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to run the associated tests, then the environment also requires\n",
    "\n",
    "- `papermill`\n",
    "\n",
    "Both are installed into a conda environment by running the following command in the same directory as this notebook:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "conda env create -f dbapi_conda.yml\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Other dependencies\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, you must also have:\n",
    "\n",
    "- An azure databricks workspace\n",
    "- Appropriate permissions to create and modify clusters \n",
    "- A personal access token for authentication to the workspace (see below).\n",
    "\n",
    "We also assume that you have cloned or downloaded the [Microsoft Recommenders repository](https://github.com/Microsoft/Recommenders). This notebook is a part\n",
    "of that repository, \n",
    "You must adjust the variable `path_to_recommenders_repo_root` in order to upload that as a library.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Authentication Instructions\n",
    "\n",
    "This will work through an example using a personal access token.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to use this approach, you need to generate a databricks personal access token.\n",
    "\n",
    "To do so, do the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Click on the `user` icon on the top right\n",
    "- Click on the `User Settings` menu item\n",
    "- Select the `Access Tokens` tab\n",
    "- Click on the `Generate Access Token`\n",
    "- Fill in the requested fields\n",
    "\n",
    "Copy that token into a file called `.env` with the format:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "DB_ACCESS_TOKEN=<THISISMYLONGSTRINGFROMDATABRICKS>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If `TOKEN` is left empty, we will use this file later with the `python-dotenv` package to load the access token in such a way that it is not visible\n"
