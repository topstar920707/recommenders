# Model

In this directory, notebooks are provided to give a deep dive into training models using different algorithms such as
 Alternating Least Squares ([ALS](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/python/_modules/pyspark/ml/recommendation.html#ALS)) and Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) using [Surprise](http://surpriselib.com/) python package. The notebooks make use of the utility functions ([reco_utils](../../reco_utils))
 available in the repo.
