    "In Light Graph Convolution, only the normalized sum of neighbor embeddings is performed towards next layer; other operations like self-connection, feature transformation, and nonlinear activation are all removed, which largely simplifies GCNs. In Layer Combination, we sum over the embeddings at each layer to obtain the final representations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.1 Light Graph Convolution (LGC)\n",
    "\n",
    "In LightGCN, we adopt the simple weighted sum aggregator and abandon the use of feature transformation and nonlinear activation. The graph convolution operation in LightGCN is defined as:\n",
    "\n",

    "In LightGCN, the only trainable model parameters are the embeddings at the 0-th layer, i.e., $\\mathbf{e}_{u}^{(0)}$ for all users and $\\mathbf{e}_{i}^{(0)}$ for all items. When they are given, the embeddings at higher layers can be computed via LGC.
