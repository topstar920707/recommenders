    "## Introduction to Azure Machine Learning  \n",
    "The **[Azure Machine Learning service (AzureML)](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/machine-learning/service/overview-what-is-azure-ml)** provides a cloud-based environment you can use to prep data, train, test, deploy, manage, and track machine learning models. By using Azure Machine Learning service, you can start training on your local machine and then scale out to the cloud. With many available compute targets, like [Azure Machine Learning Compute](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/service/how-to-set-up-training-targets#amlcompute) and [Azure Databricks](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-databricks/what-is-azure-databricks), and with [advanced hyperparameter tuning services](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/service/how-to-tune-hyperparameters), you can build better models faster by using the power of the cloud.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data scientists and AI developers use the main [Azure Machine Learning Python SDK](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/python/api/overview/azure/ml/intro?view=azure-ml-py) to build and run machine learning workflows with the Azure Machine Learning service. You can interact with the service in any Python environment, including Jupyter Notebooks or your favorite Python IDE. The Azure Machine Learning SDK allows you the choice of using local or cloud compute resources, while managing and maintaining the complete data science workflow from the cloud.\n",

    "\n",
    "This noteboook provides a scaffold to directly submit an existing notebook to AzureML compute targets. Now a user doesn't have to rewrite the training script, instead, just by replacing file name, now user can submit notebook directly.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Advantages of using AzureML:\n",
    "- Manage cloud resources for monitoring, logging, and organizing your machine learning experiments.\n",
    "- Train models either locally or by using cloud resources, including GPU-accelerated model training.\n",
    "- Easy to scale out when dataset grows - by just creating and pointing to new compute target\n",
    "\n",
    "### Prerequisities\n",
    "   - **Azure Subscription**\n",
    "     - If you don’t have an Azure subscription, create a free account before you begin. Try the [free or paid version of Azure Machine Learning service today](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/services/machine-learning/).\n",
    "     - You get credits to spend on Azure services, which will easily cover the cost of running this example notebook. After they're used up, you can keep the account and use [free Azure services](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/). Your credit card is never charged unless you explicitly change your settings and ask to be charged. Or [activate MSDN subscriber benefits](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/member-offers/credit-for-visual-studio-subscribers/), which give you credits every month that you can use for paid Azure services.\n",
