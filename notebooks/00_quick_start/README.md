# Quick Start

In this directory, notebooks are provided to help users use various algorithms,
i.e., ALS, SAR, etc., for establishing a recommendation end-to-end pipeline that consists of
data preparing, model buliding, and model evaluating, by using the [utility functions](../../reco_utils)
 available in the repo.
 
 | Notebook | Description | 
| --- | --- | 
| [als_pyspark_movielens](als_pyspark_movielens.ipynb) | Utilizing the ALS algorithm to power movie ratings in a PySpark environment.
| [sar_python_cpu_movielens](sar_single_node_movielens.ipynb) | Utilizing the Smart Adaptive Recommendations (SAR) algorithm to power movie ratings in a Python+CPU environment.
