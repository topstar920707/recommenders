# Quick Start

In this directory, notebooks are provided to help users use various algorithms,
i.e., ALS, SAR, etc., for establishing a recommendation end-to-end pipeline that consists of
data preparing, model buliding, and model evaluating, by using the [utility functions](../../reco_utils)
 available in the repo.
