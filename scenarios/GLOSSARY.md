

* Click-through rate (CTR): Optimizing for CTR emphasizes engagement; you should optimize for CTR when you want to maximize the likelihood that the user interacts with the recommendation.

* Collaborative filtering algorithms: This type of recommendation system makes predictions of what might interest a person based on the taste of many other users. It assumes that if person X likes Snickers, and person Y likes Snickers and Milky Way, then person X might like Milky Way as well. See the [list of examples in Recommenders repository](../../examples/02_model_collaborative_filtering).

* Content-based filtering algorithms: This type of recommendation system focuses on the products themselves and recommends other products that have similar attributes. Content-based filtering relies on the characteristics of the products themselves, so it doesnâ€™t rely on other users to interact with the products before making a recommendation. See the [list of examples in Recommenders repository](../../examples/02_model_content_based_filtering).

* Conversion rate: Optimizing for conversion rate maximizes the likelihood that the user purchases the recommended item; if you want to increase the number of purchases per session, optimize for conversion rate.

* Diversity metrics:

* Hybrid filtering algorithms: This type of recommendation system can implement a combination fo any two of the above systems. See the [list of examples in Recommenders repository](../../examples/02_model_hybrid).

* Knowledge-base algorithms: ...

* Ranking metrics:

* Rating metrics:

* Revenue per order: The revenue per order optimization objective is the default optimization objective for the "Frequently bought together" recommendation model type. This optimization objective cannot be specified for any other recommendation model type.
