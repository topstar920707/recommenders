# Recommendation systems for Retail

An increasing number of online companies are utilizing recommendation systems to increase user interaction and enrich shopping potential. Use cases of recommendation systems have been expanding rapidly across many aspects of eCommerce and online media over the last 4-5 years, and we expect this trend to continue.

Companies across many different areas of enterprise are beginning to implement recommendation systems in an attempt to enhance their customer’s online purchasing experience, increase sales and retain customers. Business owners are recognizing potential in the fact that recommendation systems allow the collection of a huge amount of information relating to user’s behavior and their transactions within an enterprise. This information can then be systematically stored within user profiles to be used for future interactions.

## Types of Recommendation Systems for Retail

Typically recommendation systems in retail can be divided into three categories:

* Collaborative filtering: This type of recommendation system makes predictions of what might interest a person based on the taste of many other users. It assumes that if person X likes Snickers, and person Y likes Snickers and Milky Way, then person X might like Milky Way as well.

* Content-based filtering: This type of recommendation system focuses on the products themselves and recommends other products that have similar attributes. Content-based filtering relies on the characteristics of the products themselves, so it doesn’t rely on other users to interact with the products before making a recommendation.

* Hybrid filtering: This type of recommendation system can implement a combination fo any two of the above systems.
